            My name is Dhairya Mehta, and I‚Äôm a 14-year-old chess player with a deep passion for the game.  
            I currently hold a USCF rating of 2150 and have competed in over 150 tournaments across the country.  
            Chess has been a big part of my life for many years, and I love both the strategy and the challenge it brings.

            In addition to playing competitively, I enjoy teaching others and sharing what I‚Äôve learned.  
            I‚Äôve run a chess summer camp, where I coached younger players in a fun and supportive environment,  
            and I‚Äôve also conducted one-on-one coaching sessions with students looking to improve their game.

            Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or looking to take your skills to the next level,  
            I‚Äôm excited to help you grow and enjoy the game as much as I do.
