    st.markdown("""
Learning to play chess offers students an opportunity to sharpen their intellect and develop essential life skills.  
The game is a powerful tool for enhancing critical thinking, strategic planning, and decision-making under pressure.  
Each move requires thorough analysis and foresight, encouraging players to weigh consequences and anticipate outcomes.  

Beyond cognitive benefits, chess also fosters patience, discipline, and resilience‚Äîqualities that translate to academic  
and personal success. As students navigate complex challenges both on and off the board, chess equips them with a mindset  
of perseverance and ability to make wise decisions, making it a valuable addition to a child‚Äôs growth.
