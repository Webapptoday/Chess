        My name is Dhairya Mehta, and Iâ€™m a 14-year-old chess player with a deep passion for the game.  
        I currently hold a USCF rating of 2150 and have competed in over 150 tournaments across the country.

        In addition to playing competitively, I enjoy teaching others and sharing what Iâ€™ve learned.  
        Iâ€™ve run a chess summer camp, where I coached younger players in a fun and supportive environment,  
        and Iâ€™ve also conducted one-on-one coaching sessions with students looking to improve their game.  
        Whether youâ€™re just starting out or looking to take your skills to the next level,  
        Iâ€™m excited to help you grow and enjoy the game as much as I do.

    Learning to play chess offers students an opportunity to sharpen their intellect and develop essential life skills.  
    The game is a powerful tool for enhancing critical thinking, strategic planning, and decision-making under pressure.  
    Each move requires thorough analysis and foresight, encouraging players to weigh consequences and anticipate outcomes.

    Beyond cognitive benefits, chess also fosters patience, discipline, and resilienceâ€”qualities that translate  
    to academic and personal success. As students navigate complex challenges both on and off the board,  
    chess equips them with a mindset of perseverance and ability to make wise decisions,  
    making it a valuable addition to a childâ€™s growth.
