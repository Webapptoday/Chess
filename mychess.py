My name is Dhairya Mehta, and Iâ€™m a 14-year-old chess player with a deep passion for the game.  
I currently hold a USCF rating of 2150 and have competed in over 150 tournaments across the country.

In addition to playing competitively, I enjoy teaching others and sharing what Iâ€™ve learned.  
Iâ€™ve run a chess summer camp, where I coached younger players in a fun and supportive environment,

Whether youâ€™re just starting out or looking to take your skills to the next level,  
Iâ€™m excited to help you grow and enjoy the game as much as I do.

Learning to play chess offers students an opportunity to sharpen their intellect and develop essential life skills.  
The game is a powerful tool for enhancing critical thinking, strategic planning, and decision-making under pressure.  
Each move requires thorough analysis and foresight, encouraging players to weigh consequences and anticipate outcomes.

Beyond cognitive benefits, chess also fosters patience, discipline, and resilienceâ€”qualities that translate  
to academic and personal success. As students navigate complex challenges both on and off the board,  
chess equips them with a mindset of perseverance and ability to make wise decisions,  
making it a valuable addition to a childâ€™s growth.
